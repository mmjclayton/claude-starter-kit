Start a new session by executing the Agent SOP session start checklist. Read every file listed below, in order. Do not skip any step.

## Step 1: Read CLAUDE.md

Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root. This is the master context file containing stack, conventions, dispatch table, priority items, and session checklists.

## Step 2: Read memory files

Read these local memory files:
- `~/.claude/projects/[project-hash]/memory/MEMORY.md` (auto-memory index)
- `~/.claude/projects/[project-hash]/memory/project_resume.md` (last session snapshot)

If `project_resume.md` does not exist, note this and continue.

## Step 3: Read agent memory

Read `docs/agent-memory.md`. This contains cross-session decisions, gotchas, data model invariants, preferences, and in-flight work status.

Check the In-Flight Work section. If it is populated, the previous session was interrupted. Read the build plan Batch Log (linked from CLAUDE.md) before starting new work.

## Step 4: Check git history

Run `git log --oneline -10` and cross-check against:
- Recent Work in CLAUDE.md (do the commit refs match?)
- Completed Work in agent-memory.md (is anything missing?)
- project_resume.md "What was done" (does it match the latest commits?)

If anything is inconsistent, flag it before proceeding.

## Step 5: Read the current work item

Read the specific Backlog item(s) listed under Current Priority Items in CLAUDE.md. Read the full item in `Backlog.md` including acceptance criteria.

If there is an active build plan (linked in CLAUDE.md under Build Plans), read its Architecture and Batch Log sections.

## Step 6: Report readiness

After completing all reads, report:
- What the current priority item is
- Whether the previous session ended cleanly or was interrupted
- Any inconsistencies found between files
- What you are ready to work on

Do not begin coding until you have completed all 6 steps.
